# Tideline

Tideline is an app for the Pebble smartwatch that adds tide information to the Pebble Timeline. It also supports viewing tide info directly in the app.

This app was selected as a winner of the Pebble Timeline challenge! You can [read about it here.](http://developer.getpebble.com/blog/2015/07/02/timeline-challenge-week-nine/) I would love to see some ideas for a better user interface so fork away people. 

This currently builds under version 3.3 of the pebble SDK. 

Any questions please contact tideline.watchapp@gmail.com
